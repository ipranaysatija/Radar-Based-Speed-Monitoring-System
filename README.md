# Radar Based Speed Measurment System
This project involves the development of a radar system leveraging the Doppler effect to accurately measure the speed of moving vehicles. The system emits a continuous microwave signal towards the target vehicle and receives the reflected signal. By analyzing the frequency shift between the transmitted and reflected signals, the speed of the vehicle is calculated.
